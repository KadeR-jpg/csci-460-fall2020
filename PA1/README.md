# Program Assignment one
## Kade Pitsch
UHHH this program has been rough but anyways here it is.
* For my program i think i took a pretty *normal* approach maybe a little more convoluted than others. 
* Within main i am taking user input to get the directory 
* Then using some dirent.h methods ensuring that we are in the correct directory
* This is where things get goofy, dont judge my file clearing method
* I am storing the captions in a text file because i was not able to get any other method working.
* The HTML portion of the program does not exist, i just did not have time to implement it but i think i got everything else working relatively right.
* I was able to convert images in the background while the user is entering information.
* Refer to the diagram
